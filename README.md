# The Methodological Pitfall of Dataset-Driven Research on Deep Learning: An IoT Example

This repo includes the model implementation and the data for paper: *The Methodological Pitfall of Dataset-Driven Research on Deep Learning: An IoT Example* 

In this paper, we highlight a dangerous pitfall in the state-of-the-art evaluation methodology of deep learning algorithms. It results in deceptively good evaluation outcomes on test datasets, whereas the underlying algorithms remain prone to catastrophic failure in practice.
